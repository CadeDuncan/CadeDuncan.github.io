<h2>6th grade</h2>
<p>Sixth Grade was kind of our main year of ATM because we learned how to do the basics. The basics would be things such as typing without looking at your fingers, learning how to use microsoft word, microsoft excel, and microsoft power point. We also just learned how to basically use the internet and how to be safe on it. 6th grade was probably my least favorite year just because it was more boring that other things we learned in other years.</p>

<h2>7th grade</h2>
	<p>7th grade was probably my favorite year in the ATM program. We did my most favorite thing that we have ever done in ATM, which is photoshop and illustrator</p>

<h2>8th grade</h2>
<p>I have many interests but these are my favorites: Youtube, Baseball, Games, and Basketball. I really do like to watch Youtube a lot, because I like a lot of Youtubers and the videos they put up. My favorites are probably Danny Duncan, Andrew Hales, CJ So Cool, Jesser the Lazzer, CashNasty, Kristopher London (LSK), and Kent Murphy. Like I said in my hobbies category, I love baseball and I look forward to having a future in it. I do have an interest in video games, but only some. I like to play games that are sports related and I also like some Call of Duty games, like first person shooters, and I also like Grand Theft Auto 5. Basketball is my second favorite sport, but I dont play on a real team or anything. I just like to play for fun with friends, and family. Im actually really good at basketball because I have a good shot and because im tall.</p>
